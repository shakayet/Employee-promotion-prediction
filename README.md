Employee Promotion Prediction 🚀
This is my final year machine learning project, aimed at predicting employee promotions using supervised classification techniques. 
The project utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to analyze employee data and determine promotion eligibility with a focus on accuracy.

Key Features ✨
Predictive Model: Built using the Random Forest algorithm for high accuracy.
Large Dataset: Trained on a dataset with 78,000 data points, ensuring robust performance.
Comprehensive Features: Includes various attributes like department, region, education, gender, recruitment channel, number of trainings, age, previous year rating, length of service, KPIs met, awards won, and average training score.
Evaluation Metrics: Focus on accuracy for model evaluation.
Problem Statement 📄
The goal of this project is to predict whether an employee will be promoted based on their historical and performance data. The model helps HR teams streamline the promotion process by identifying potential candidates efficiently.

Technical Stack 🛠️
Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Algorithm: Random Forest

Observations 🔍
The model demonstrates high training accuracy but shows a slight bias towards training data, highlighting areas for further fine-tuning.
Insights and data visualizations provided for better interpretability of model predictions.

How to Run 🖥️
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-promotion-prediction.git  
cd employee-promotion-prediction  
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model and make predictions.
